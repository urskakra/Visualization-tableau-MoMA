# Project 3: Tableau visualization with MoMA

## Context

The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) of New York City was founded in 1929 by three influential female art patrons, Lillie P. Bliss, Mary Quinn Sullivan, and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, who recognized a need for a different kind of art institution that would focus exclusively on modern art. 

From the very beginning, MoMA aimed to be a pioneer in showcasing the latest trends and movements in art. They wanted to break away from the traditional approach and embrace the experimental, innovative, and diverse forms of artistic expression that were emerging in the early 20th century.

Since its establishment, MoMA has grown and evolved significantly, and today hosts almost 200.000 artworks. It has become one of the most influential and prestigious art institutions globally, known for its extensive collection, groundbreaking exhibitions, and educational programs.

Nowadays, we can still encounter underrepresentation of women in the arts world, which is a complex issue with historical, social, and systemic roots. Up to date, women have not been treated equally in the art world, and today they remain dramatically underrepresented and undervalued in museums, galleries, and auction houses.

## Objective

Clean, explore and analyze the dataset, from the perspective of artwork creation, artwork acquisition, artist nationality and gender, with focus on gender inclusion imbalance.

This analysis includes 130.200 artworks, added to MoMA's collection up to the year 2016.

## Methods

#### 1. ETL | Python, SQL
- cleaning and transforming dataset with Pandas and Regex libraries
- loading and joining tables in MySQL workbench

#### 2. Visualization | Tableau
